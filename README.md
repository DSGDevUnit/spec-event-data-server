Each entry of the `data` array has the following structure

	"country": "",
	"coordinates": [X, Y],

		"$oid": ""
	}
}
```
The intial database contains 2368 such cameo event records.

##How to query for that data:

We are using Mongo DB query syntax. The query is expressed in JSON Format. Here is some examples - 

Find all the events with cameo code 033

`{"code": "033"}`

Find all the events with camoe code 030 and has "Seoul" as location

`{"code":"030", "location":"Seoul"}`

Find all the events that has "United States of America" as source or target.

`{"$or":[{"source":"United States of America"}, {"target":"United States of America"}]}`
